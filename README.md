# STOCK PORTFOLIO MANAGER

## Functionality
Manage customers share portfolio by allowing selling and buying.

## Project objective
Learn some fundamental concept in python including and and not limited to:
1. Object-Oriented Programming(OOP)
2. Documentation of code in python 
3. Type hints
4. iterators
5. Testing
6. Error handling
7. Use of common python standard library modules i.e. Datetime, uuid, unittest and more
8. Packaging 
9. Python project distribution

## Running the projects
1. Running as main module using the __name__ == "__main__": construct.

    In Python, the construct if __name__ == "__main__": is used to determine whether a Python script is being run as the 
    main program or is being imported as a module into another script. 
    It referred to as the "main guard" or the "main check."
    
    Purpose of if __name__ == "__main__":
    Distinguishing Execution Context:
    
    When a Python script is executed directly (e.g., by running python script.py from the command line), 
    the special variable __name__ is set to "__main__".
    When a Python script is imported as a module in another script (e.g., import script), the __name__ variable is set 
    to the name of the module ("script" in this case).
    
    Controlling Execution Flow:
    The main guard allows you to execute certain code only when the script is run directly, 
    and prevent that code from running when the script is imported as a module. 
    This is useful for including test code, example usage, or command-line interface logic.

2. As imported module in another --> open 'explorer.py' and experiment as instructed there
